## 🙌 Acknowledgments

This project was originally inspired by a course from **Jonas Schmedtmann**. While the core idea comes from the course, I have made some enhancements, including:

✅ **Migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript** for better type safety and maintainability.

✅ **Refactoring and optimizing the codebase** for cleaner, more efficient development.

✅ **Implemented a modern testing setup** using Vitest and Testing Library for confidence and maintainability.
